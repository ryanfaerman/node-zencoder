# node-zencoder -- zencode from node.js

This is just a basic wrapper for the Zencoder API. It follows most of the conventions in their ruby gem https://github.com/zencoder/zencoder-rb/

Checkout `zen_test.coffee` to see all the possible uses, or look at their gem documentation.

When using coffee-script, the syntax is nearly the same.

## Install

  npm install zencoder
