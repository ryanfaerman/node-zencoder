# Important 

This project (and module) is in the process of being taken over by the developers at Zencoder. I'll update this repo and provide links to the zencoder repositories once that occurs.


# node-zencoder -- zencode from node.js
This is just a basic wrapper for the Zencoder API. It follows most of the conventions in their ruby gem https://github.com/zencoder/zencoder-rb/

Checkout `zen_test.coffee` to see all the possible uses, or look at their gem documentation.

When using coffee-script, the syntax is nearly the same.

## Install

  npm install zencoder
